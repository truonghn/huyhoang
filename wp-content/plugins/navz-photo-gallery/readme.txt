A cool plugin that extends the Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) functionality to add ‘Photo Gallery’ to any post/pages of your choice.

== Description ==
We are just a lightweight extension of Advanced Custom Field (ACF) that adds ‘Photo Gallery’ field to any post/pages on your WordPress website. 

* Visually create your Fields
* Add multiple photos and you can also modify title, caption and link to anything
* Assign your fields to multiple edit pages (via custom location rules)
* Easily load data through a simple and friendly API
* Uses the native WordPress custom post type for ease of use and fast processing
* Uses the native WordPress metadata for ease of use and fast processing

= Usage =
The following example is using Twitter Bootstrap framework to layout. You can use any framework of your choice.
`<?php
	//Get the images ids from the post_metadata
	$images = acf_photo_gallery('gallery_images', $post->ID);
	//Check if return array has anything in it
	if( count($images) ):
		//Cool, we got some data so now let's loop over it
		foreach($images as $image):
			$title = $image['title']; //The title
			$caption= $image['caption']; //The caption
			$full_image_url= $image['full_image_url']; //Full size image url
			$full_image_url = acf_photo_gallery_resize_image($full_image_url, 262, 160); //Resized size to 262px width by 160px height image url
			$thumbnail_image_url= $image['thumbnail_image_url']; //Get the thumbnail size image url 150px by 150px
			$url= $image['url']; //Goto any link when clicked
			$target= $image['target']; //Open normal or new tab
			$alt = get_field('photo_gallery_alt', $id); //Get the alt which is a extra field (See below how to add extra fields)
			$class = get_field('photo_gallery_class', $id); //Get the class which is a extra field (See below how to add extra fields)
?>
<div class="col-xs-6 col-md-3">
	<div class="thumbnail">
		<?php if( !empty($url) ){ ?><a href="<?php echo $url; ?>" <?php echo ($target == 'true' )? 'target="_blank"': ''; ?>><?php } ?>
			<img src="<?php echo $full_image_url; ?>" alt="<?php echo $title; ?>" title="<?php echo $title; ?>">
		<?php if( !empty($url) ){ ?></a><?php } ?>
	</div>
</div>
<?php endforeach; endif; ?>`

= Add Extra Fields =
To add extra fields add the following to your themes functions.php file.

`//Create extra fields called Altnative Text and Custom Classess
function my_extra_gallery_fields( $args, $attachment_id, $field ){
	$args['alt'] = array('type' => 'text', 'label' => 'Altnative Text', 'name' => 'alt', 'value' => get_field($field . '_alt', $attachment_id) ); // Creates Altnative Text field
	$args['class'] = array('type' => 'text', 'label' => 'Custom Classess', 'name' => 'class', 'value' => get_field($field . '_class', $attachment_id) ); // Creates Custom Classess field
	return $args;
}
add_filter( 'acf_photo_gallery_image_fields', 'my_extra_gallery_fields', 10, 3 );`

= How to get values of extra fields =
You can use ACF helper function `get_field`
`get_field('photo_gallery_alt', $id);
get_field('photo_gallery_class', $id);`
